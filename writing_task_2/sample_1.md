#### articles

it is important for us to relax when we're off work or study.
in order to have a better state for working and studying,
appropriate physical or mind acticities are necessary.

however, different kind of people may need different types of activities.
people who work physically may need mind improvment activities, such as word puzzles,
watching TED speeches and so on. if you are a constraction worker or nurse.
you may feel too exhausted to do any running after a day physically work.

while some people who do things indoor need outside activites,
running, playing table tennis or go hiking . as for those who are programers
for example. is a good choice.

in addition, another key factor that influence our choice of lesure is where we work.


#### model

It is generally accepted that we all need leisure time to recover from the stresses of work and everyday life.
Personally, I prefer to be active during this time, as I think this suits me better. However, what we do with our leisure time is up to us and no one can say that any particular activity is the best.

Some people relax by watching movies, reading or surfing the internet. People who have physically demanding jobs may choose these types of activities. If you are a nurse or builder, you may feel that you don't want to do a five-kilometre run after work, because you are already physically tired.

Other people do very sedentary jobs. Computer analysts, for example, may spend all day sitting in front of a computer screen. At the end of the working day, they may be keen to stretch their limbs and improve their health by swimming or going to the gym.

Another factor that influences our choice of leisure pursuit is where we work. People who work indoors often prefer outdoor hobbies, whereas for people who work outdoors, the reverse may be true. I am a student myself and this involves a lot of sitting in lectures, so I need to get out into the fresh air afterwards.

In any situation, the important thing is that people need to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. The only wrong way to spend free time, in my view, is to have a sedentary job and then go home and watch television.
